### Python examples

The Python examples run in python3. To run a jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook VAE_example.ipynb
```
It should then open in your web browser.

* **VAE_example.ipynb** : a notebook that implements the variational auto-encoder from Kingma & Welling and recreates some of the figures from the paper.
* **VAE.py** : this is the network for VAE_example.ipynb
