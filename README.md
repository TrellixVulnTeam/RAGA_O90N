### Structured Variational Inference for Simulating Populations of Radio Galaxies - RAGA-1 (Radio Astronomy Generative Algorithm - version 1)

The Radio Astronomy Generative Algorithm - version 1 is the first of a series of generative algorithms engineered for simulating radio sources in view of the simulation of future radio surveys like the SKA. 

```bash
jupyter notebook VAE_example.ipynb
```
It should then open in your web browser.

* **VAE_example.ipynb** : a notebook that implements the variational auto-encoder from Kingma & Welling and recreates some of the figures from the paper.
* **VAE.py** : this is the network for VAE_example.ipynb
